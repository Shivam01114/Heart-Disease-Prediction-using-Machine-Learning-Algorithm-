🚀 Project: Logistic Regression Model for Classification

I recently built and trained a Logistic Regression machine learning model using Python to classify data efficiently and accurately.

🔍 Key Highlights:

Implemented Logistic Regression with the liblinear solver for small datasets

Performed data preprocessing, train-test split, and model fitting

Evaluated model using accuracy score and other metrics

Learned how different solvers optimize the cost function in ML models

Improved understanding of gradient-based optimization techniques


💡 This project helped me strengthen my fundamentals in supervised learning, especially how solvers like liblinear efficiently find optimal model parameters.
